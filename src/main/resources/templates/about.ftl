    <h2>What is Before Deployment?</h2>
    <p>This site is intended to help new Warmachine/Hordes players learn how top level players go about creating lists based on other 
players in a tournament, what they think about during list selection and how they decide between picking a table edge or taking first turn. Basically all decisions made 'Before Deployment'.</p>
    <p>The aim isn't to come up with a set of rules for such things as 'which list do I choose for this opponent', but rather explain the 
thinking behind these decisions. It is more about the WHY than the WHAT. By simulating a tournament setup with changing tables and opponents, the idea
is that players will be able to provide more helpful information about why they made certain decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Players are invited to a 'tournament'. They know who the other players are, but not what lists (or even factions) they are bringing. They 
then design a list pairing that they think will be competitive and submit it to this site. Once all players have submitted their lists, they will all be
published here along with the players thoughts about the lists they are bringing to the 'tournament'.</p>
    <p>Players will then be randomly paired up with an opponent and given an image of the table with terrain and a scenario. 
They then are asked to choose which list they would use in this match and then answer various questions such as:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">Was deciding which list to use an easy decision?</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Did the terrain influence your decision?</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Did the scenario influence your decision?</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Which list do you think your opponent will choose?</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">If you won the dice off, what would you choose - first turn or table edge?</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
    These won't just be simple yes/no answers, the players will be asked to explain why they answered as they did.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once both players have submitted their answers, the matchup and their responses will be published for everyone to look at and learn from. 
The players are then matched up with new opponents and tables/scenarios and the process starts again.
