    <h2>What is Before Deploy?</h2>
    <p>This site is intended to help new Warmachine/Hordes players learn how top level players go about creating lists based on other 
players in a tournament, what they think about during list selection and how they decide between picking a table edge or taking first turn. Basically all decisions made before deployment.</p>
    <p>The aim isn't to come up with a set of rules for such things as 'which list do I choose for this opponent', but rather explain the 
thinking behind these decisions. It is more about the WHY than the WHAT. By simulating a tournament setup with changing tables and opponents, the idea
is that players will be able to provide concrete details about why they made certain decisions rather than generalised statements about .</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Players are invited to a virtual 'tournament'. They know who the other players are, but not what lists (or even factions) they are bringing. They 
then design a list pairing that they think will be competitive and submit it to this site along with their responses to some questions about their lists.</p>
      <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="example-list-questions" role="button">View example list questions &raquo;</a>
    <p></p>
    <p>Once all players have submitted their lists, they will all be published here along with the players responses.</p>
    <p>Players will then be randomly paired up with an opponent and given an image of the table with terrain and a scenario. 
They then are asked to choose which list they would use in this matchup and then answer some more questions.</p>
    <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="example-matchup-questions" role="button">View example matchup questions &raquo;</a>
    <p></p>
    <p>Once both players have submitted their answers, the matchup and their responses will be published for everyone to look at and learn from. 
The players are then matched up with new opponents and tables/scenarios and the process starts again.</p>
  
    <h2>Prospective Player FAQ</h2>
    <h3>If I sign up as a player, how much time will I need to spend filling in answers for my list?</h3> 
    <p>Ideally less than 30 minutes, but it is really up to you. The submission form will save automatically so you don't have to do everything in one sitting.</p>

    <h3>If I sign up as a player, how much time will I need to spend filling in answers every matchup?</h3> 
    <p>Again, ideally less than 30 minutes per matchup, but again, it is really up to you. You can make your responses as detailed as you like. The answers will save automatically
    as you write them so you can spend a few minutes here and there until they are all complete.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I answer the questions on my phone?</h3> 
    <p>Yes. The site has been designed with this in mind.</p>

    <h3>How many players are there going to be?</h3> 
    <p>At the moment, no idea :) Ideally there would be enough to get a good cross section of factions so new players have a chance of seeing their chosen faction.
If you know people who might be interested in taking part, feel free to send them a link to this page.</>

    <h3>What type of lists do I need to submit?</h3> 
    <p>Two standard 50 point Steamroller lists. They can be lists you have used in the past or brand new. Keep in mind though that while this isn't a real tournament, one of the goals
    of this site is to help newer players so explaining how your lists work is important.</p>

    <h3>What do I get out of it?</h3> 
    <p>You'll be helping new players learn what things to think about before deployment. Also, on your bio page you can have links/logos for anything you want to promote such as your store or podcast.</p>

    <h3>What does this website get out of it?</h3> 
    <p>The same as the other users of the site. It was developed by a player who is just starting to go to tournaments and was looking for a way to learn what sort of decisions to make. 
As far as monetary rewards go, there are none. The costs of running this site are coming out of the developers pocket. If you want to sponsor the site to help with the costs, he'd be happy about that :)</p>

    <h3>Will I need to remember another username and password to use this site?</h3> 
    <p>No. At the start of the tournament you will be sent a link unique to you to use to submit your lists. This link will only work until you have succesfully submitted the questionnaire. Same goes for
the per matchup questions - a link that is unique for you.</p>

    <h3>How will I get this link?</h3> 
    <p>It will either be emailed to you or sent as a direct message on twitter (or both). You can decide when you register to participate. You will need to follow the @beforedeploy twitter account if you want to recieve the link as a DM.</p>

    <h3>How frequent are the matchups?</h3> 
    <p>Because there are no actual games played so no rankings, after each pair of players has submitted their matchup questionnaire and had their answers published, 
they are then free to participate in the next matchup. At the moment the plan is to publish each matchup answers as soon as the second player submits their answers. 
Links for the next matchup would probably go out about a week after that. Depending on how many players there are, or if some players are taking a long time to answer, 
the next matchup might be sent out before the previous one is published.</p>
    
    <h3>I want in. How do I sign up?</h3>
    <p>If you wish to participate, either send an email to <a href="mailto:before.deploy@gmail.com">before.deploy@gmail.com</a> or send a tweet to  
    <a href="https://twitter.com/beforedeploy">@beforedeploy</a> on twitter. Once this site is ready, you will be contacted and asked for your bio/links/etc and how you wish to be notified. 
Once all the players are registered you will be sent your first link to submit your lists.</p>
    
    <h3>What happens if I want to drop out?</h3> 
    <p>Not a problem. Just email/tweet that you'd like to stop participating and you will no longer be paired up for matches. You will stay listed on the player list screen. 
It would be good if you could complete your current match questionnaire though so your opponents time isn't wasted.</p>
    
    <h3>When does everything go live?</h3>
    <p>Good question. It depends on how quickly enough players sign up. This site is still under development, but ideally it will be ready by the time Lock and Load comes around.</p>
